# Enhanced Hybrid Recommendation System Utilizing Collaborative Filtering and Generative AI

Hybrid Recommendation System project, a sophisticated blend of collaborative filtering and generative AI using the GPT-2 language model. This innovative system is designed to offer highly personalized recommendations across various domains such as movies, products, or articles, adapting seamlessly to specific needs.

## Overview
Recommendation systems are pivotal in improving user engagement and satisfaction on digital platforms by suggesting relevant items based on user preferences and behavior. Our project uniquely combines collaborative filtering with the capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) through the GPT-2 model, aiming to provide superior accuracy and personalization in recommendations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Environment Setup**: Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.
- **Dependencies**: Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal to install the necessary Python packages.
- **Dataset Acquisition**: Download the Amazon Reviews dataset from Kaggle and place it in your project directory, ensuring it's ready for preprocessing.

### Data Preparation
The dataset undergoes comprehensive preprocessing to eliminate duplicates and handle missing values efficiently. It's further processed to generate sequences of user-item interactions, which are crucial for the subsequent fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model.

### Collaborative Filtering Technique
Our system leverages collaborative filtering to uncover user similarities based on their interaction histories. This technique allows us to recommend items by considering the preferences of users with similar tastes, enhancing the recommendation's relevance.

### GPT-2 Model Fine-tuning
We employ a fine-tuning process on the GPT-2 model using the prepared sequences from our dataset. This process adapts the model to generate textual recommendations that are highly personalized, leveraging the model's advanced language understanding capabilities.

### Personalized Recommendation Generation
The core of our system integrates the collaborative filtering insights with the generative prowess of the fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This hybrid approach ensures that the recommendations are not only based on user similarities but also enriched with the context and nuances captured by the generative AI.

### System Evaluation
The efficacy of our recommendation system is rigorously assessed using a suite of metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These metrics collectively offer a holistic view of the system's performance, accuracy, and reliability.

## Key Features and Innovations
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Our system features sophisticated preprocessing to ensure data quality and readiness for modeling.
- **Optimized Model Parameters**: Through meticulous hyperparameter tuning, we enhance the performance of both the collaborative filtering algorithm and the GPT-2 model.
- **Reliability and Robustness**: We incorporate comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to maintain the system's reliability and user trust.

## Conclusion
Hybrid Recommendation System represents a significant leap forward in recommendation technology, merging the analytical power of collaborative filtering with the creative intelligence of generative AI. It stands as a testament to the potential of combining traditional algorithms with the latest advancements in NLP for creating deeply personalized user experiences.
